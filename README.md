# Jekyll Curse

Curse words are fun. However, what is better are when they are replaced with characters so only the first and last letter are visible.

## Install

```
gem 'jekyll-curse'
```

## Usage

Add the following to the gems section in your `_config.yml` file.

```
- jekyll-curse
```

And away you go!
